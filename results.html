        <p> You have an inspiring way of looking at the world & seeing you work towards 
            your dreams and goals is truly motivating. It's a given that you are smart but you are 
            also compassionate, tough, funny, kind, loving, and ofc super sexy (; 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Truly, I don't know where to begin. I could begin at the moment we saw each other again post-highschool 
            at Artisan. You had on a blue denim button up, some Stan Smith and a warm smile. I think I want to begin 
            when it was summertime though. We had just finished roaming around the supermarket near DonerG and we were in the car. 
            As you were driving, you held my hand and we was a moment of silence when were were just listening to Taylor Swift. 
            I realized, then, that you truly bring me a lot of comfort by just by sitting there next to me holding my hand.
            It's in those small, quiet moments that really shows your heart. I've always felt safe and supported when I'm with you. 
            When I was sad because of a bad manager, you called and helped take my mind off of it by suggesting we take a love language 
            test together. Whether it's at MeetFresh and you quickly opened your spoon wrapper before me and put it in my bowl or 
            when it's cold and you take off your jacket, thank you for always be so caring and for making life feel brighter. 
            I am so lucky to have you in my life. Whether it's spending time in the car, going to H-mart,
            dinners, or seeing you on FaceTime, talking with you on a good day/bad day/anyday is such a joy I never take for granted. 
            I love that you always seem to know the facts about evey single topic and that you must google something once you don't know 
            the answer. I love seeing all the selfies and your outfits and hearing about your day and what you ate for dinner and I look forward
            to continuing to learn about you.
        </p>

        <p> I am so so grateful you were born today babe. I hope your day today and everyday is filled with all the things that make you smile. </p>

      <p class="muted">lots of love, always, C</p>
